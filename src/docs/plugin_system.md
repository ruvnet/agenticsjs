# Agentic UI Plugin System

## Specification and Implementation Ideas

### 1. Define a Plugin Interface

Plugins should adhere to a standard interface to ensure compatibility with the core system. This interface should include:

- A unique identifier for the plugin
- Version information
- Dependencies (if any)
- Initialization function
- Cleanup function (for when the plugin is disabled or uninstalled)
- Methods to interact with the core system

Example structure:

```typescript
interface AgenticUIPlugin {
  id: string;
  version: string;
  dependencies?: string[];
  initialize: (core: AgenticUICore) => void;
  cleanup: () => void;
}
```

### 2. Create a Plugin Registry

Implement a central registry to manage all installed plugins:

- Store metadata about each plugin
- Handle plugin dependencies
- Manage plugin lifecycle (installation, activation, deactivation, uninstallation)

The registry could be implemented as a singleton class or a module with methods like:

- registerPlugin(plugin: AgenticUIPlugin)
- unregisterPlugin(pluginId: string)
- getPlugin(pluginId: string)
- listPlugins()

### 3. Implement Plugin Loading and Initialization

Create a system to dynamically load plugins:

- Use dynamic imports for loading plugin modules
- Implement a plugin loader that checks compatibility and resolves dependencies
- Initialize plugins in the correct order based on dependencies

Consider using a topological sort algorithm to determine the correct initialization order.

### 4. Provide Hooks for Plugins to Extend Functionality

Define a set of hooks or extension points in the core system where plugins can inject their functionality:

- UI hooks (e.g., adding new components to the settings panel)
- Data processing hooks (e.g., modifying search results)
- Lifecycle hooks (e.g., on application start, before search, after search)

Example hook system:

```typescript
interface HookSystem {
  addHook: (hookName: string, callback: Function) => void;
  removeHook: (hookName: string, callback: Function) => void;
  applyHooks: (hookName: string, ...args: any[]) => Promise<any[]>;
}
```

### 5. Ensure Plugin Isolation and Error Handling

Implement measures to prevent plugins from negatively impacting the core system:

- Use sandboxing techniques to isolate plugin code execution
- Implement timeout mechanisms for plugin operations
- Create an error boundary system to catch and handle plugin errors gracefully
- Provide a way for plugins to log errors and diagnostic information

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Configuration Management**: Allow plugins to have their own configuration options, which can be integrated into the main settings UI.

2. **API Versioning**: Implement a versioning system for the plugin API to ensure backward compatibility as the core system evolves.

3. **Plugin Marketplace**: Consider creating a marketplace or repository where users can discover and install plugins easily.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement a system to monitor the performance impact of installed plugins and provide this information to users.

5. **Security**: Implement a verification system for plugins to ensure they come from trusted sources and don't contain malicious code.

6. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for plugin developers, including best practices and guidelines.

7. **Testing Framework**: Develop a testing framework specifically for plugins to help developers ensure their plugins work correctly with the core system.

By implementing this plugin system, Agentic UI can become highly extensible, allowing developers to add new features and customize the application without modifying the core codebase. This approach promotes a modular architecture and can foster a community of plugin developers around the project.
